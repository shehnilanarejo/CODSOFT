Codsoft Internship
Overview
I completed a one-month virtual internship at Codsoft, a dynamic software development company. During this period, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, enhancing my skills in coding, problem-solving, and software development.

Task 1: Guess the Number Game
Description
The Guess the Number Game is a C++ console application that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program utilizes the rand() function and loops until the correct number is guessed. The user receives feedback on each guess, such as "Too low!" or "Too high!" The game concludes with a congratulatory message, revealing the correct number and the total number of attempts.

Task 2: Basic Calculator
Description
The Basic Calculator, implemented in C++, is a console application that performs arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers. Users can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program includes error handling to prevent division by zero. The result of the selected operation is then displayed.

Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Description
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a console-based implementation of the classic game in C++. The 3x3 grid is represented using a 2D array. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers. The game ends when a player has three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The result is displayed, indicating the winner or a tie.
